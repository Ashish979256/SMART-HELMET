# SMART-HELMET
This Smart Helmet Project is my B.tech project .This project has two unit one is Helmet unit and other bike unit .
Helmet Unit is responsible for detecting that driver has weared his helmet or not .and also gps and RF tranmitter is fixed in it .
Bike unit contains a relay and and RF receiver .
If helmet wearing detection is not detected the RF transmitter would not send signal to bike unit and Relay connected to bike would not be switched on.
During any accident a call with gps location would be forwarded to the family member.
I have used Thing speak cloud with  twilio to send message and call.
